# Bloatlord

This class consists of N identical figures that constitute the Oozelord organism. The themes of the class are spreading and absorbing copies to grow across the map. Much of the damage and ability output will be conditioned on Blob Size, meaning the current number of figures making up the blob

Rules:

* Any figure of the ooze can be used for purposes of targeting by the ooze and by enemies and allies
* Any AoE will only hit each contiguous blob once?
* Spread keyword means: Place a fungus figure in an empty cell adjacent to existing fungus figure
* Absorb keyword means: Remove a fungus figure from the board
* Elemental affiliation is mostly with "Any" but not generating it on its own, instead using/changing mana


Misc Notes:

* Maybe we want to split them up and stuff, can have attacks that branch off new figures. can allow absorbing from one and spreading to another
